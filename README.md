# Reddactit

A username redactor for Reddit which color-codes usernames for easy reading.

This extension will hash all usernames on a reddit tab and convert them to hexidecimal color values. Each username will get a unique color value so users can be identified across comments while hiding the actual username. Thread OPs are displayed with a blue outline.
